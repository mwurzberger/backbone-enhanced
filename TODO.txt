Tests to Perform
- Model sorting different parent vs child
- Add/Remove/Update model on parent
- Add/Remove/Update model on child
- Reset performed on parent vs on child

Add model to child
Remove model from child
Update attribute from child
Reset collection from child
Add model from parent


Action always go from parent to children
Actions only go from children to parents if they are the originator
- Prevent callback loop
- Ex. Parent Collection adds model, Triggers Add event, Child Collection runs onAdd, This adds a model, Triggers add event, (call parent, parent listening)


On Model creation if parent is set (how to do this on add?) re-write add method to directly call parent and have callback with the newly created model(s)
Internally rename the old add method to addViaProxy and have it bind to parent add event
